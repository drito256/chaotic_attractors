list of tasks to do:

    - [x] separation of Point class
    - [x] creation of Camera class
    - [ ] creation of Arrow class ? 
    - [ ] separation of shader.h -> shader.h & shader.cpp

    - when selecting different equations:
        - function to reinit point/arrow positions
        - function for changing camera location
        - scaling coordinate system net

    - will probably need to do abstraction of VAOs/VBOs/Renderer because of the previous points made

    attractors that could be shown in simulation:
        - lorenz 
        - halovrsen
        - chen
        - four-wing
        - sprott
        - thomas
        - finance
        - nose - hoover
        - aizawa
        - rossler
